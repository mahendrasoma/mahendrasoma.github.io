What is the term middleware refers? or definition of middleware? in web hosting and integration space.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Middleware is the software that will provide a platform to deploy a program/application and facilitate with various qualified integrations like messaging, database connections. In other words Middleware is also a piece of software that handles only messaging.

This is giving us an Idea that middleware is actually relying on basics of
1) Web Hosting
2) Application Hosting
3) Backend system/Data Integration Platform
4) Messaging Service

I would like to conduct a research on above topics and keep posted on this blog.
